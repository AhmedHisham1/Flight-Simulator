# Flight-Simulator-Simulink-Flightgear
Real-time flight simulation with Simulink and Matlab for solving the equations of motion and Flightgear for visualizing the states.

This project was conducted as a group project for the AER307A Flight Mechanics course at the department of aerospace engineering at Cairo university

The simulation is done on the De Havilland DHC-2 'Beaver' aircraft. However you can easily simulate a different aircraft by simply changing the aircraft-specific parameters (ie. the aero coeff., mass, inertia.. etc).

# TODO:
- A better method for adjusting the control surfaces values (rather that the slider gain)
- Adding a control loop over one of states
- Perhaps try a different aircraft
